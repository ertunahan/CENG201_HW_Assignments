## Description
This project developed for CENG201 class homework assignment.
## How to run my code
1. Clone the repository
2. Open "src" folder in IntelliJ or Eclipse

### NOTE:
On 25.12.2025, during my presentation on Microsoft Teams, I mentioned and demonstrated that I used the PriorityTreatmentQueue.java class, a technique I developed myself, to separate priority patients and normal patients using two different queues. However, you requested that I make changes. I have now removed the PriorityTreatmentQueue.java file and replaced it with a merge sorting algorithm. The latest version of my code is available here.
